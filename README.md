# AOSSOME-POS
This project is a fork of the POS-System--HTML-CSS by ishanka995 (Github). The fork is managed by AOSSOME Hosting Solutions as a way to start production of a POS system that is lightweight enough to run on our hosting solutions while offering the best of security and peace of mind. The new fork will focus on providing a more professional look of the POS System and working on the back-end development to ensure the system can keep up with your business(es) demand.

## Whitepaper
The way the POS will work is that there will be 4 menus - Customer Record Keeping, Product Management, Order Management, and Settings. As of right now, the fork is still the same as it's parent with no new changes yet. The goal of the project is to allow AOSSOME Hosting Solutions to take charge in software development of a Point of Sale system which could allow any business model to focus on digitaling their business tranactions so they can keep records that can be easily accessed by the only people meant to see. The settings page will allow the master user to dicdiate how their system is running.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. Please remember this project is meant to be a perfect foundation for any business to go digital and accept payments anywhere while ensuring there is inventory to sell and you can keep records based on how the user wants to store them.
